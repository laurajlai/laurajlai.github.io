<h1>Green Sun - Behind the Scenes</h1>
<br>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>In high school, I fancied myself an aspiring game developer, even though the only game I played semi-regularly at the time was Pok&#233;mon GO. I quickly dropped that goal when I learned how crushing game development was as a career, but most of my personal projects (i.e. things I didn't have to rush out for a grade) have been games. Over the past year, I created 5 levels of a Pygame platformer called Green Sun. I've linked the repository and game files <a href = "https://github.com/laurajlai/green_sun">here</a>. </p>

<h4>Inspirations & Beginnings</h4>
<p>I don't remember where the name "Green Sun" comes from. I think it's just because the game is green.</p>

<h4>Coding</h4>
<p>I knew for a while I wanted to make a Python project because Python is popular right now. I also wanted to make it fun, so I decided to start my Python journey with a game! Never mind that I knew more about the "game" than the "py". I knew I had a great project on the horizon.</p>

<p>Because I was learning Python on the fly, I quickly ran into problems. One major issue had to do with inheritance. Right now, the GitHub code shows every game object (blocks, flowers, portals, et cetera) inheriting from an Asset superclass. <i>That didn't exist originally.</i> I was copying the same collision function and coordinate change function again and again...until I realized around level 3 or so that I was reusing a ton of code and put the entire project on pause to fix everything. Don't worry, I learned my lesson.</p>

<p>Unlike my previous project A Whisper in Steel, this game featured pictures. I designed each and every one of them by hand on the platform Sketchpad.io, downloading them to my computer and making the game folder massive.</p>

<h4>What I Might've Done Differently</h4>
<p>Oh, where do I even begin with this one. This was my first serious Python project, and my inexperience shows. I think I'll look back on this in a few years the way I currently look back on the novel I tried writing in 6th grade.</p>
<p>The background for each level was a hard-coded static image. To compensate, I tried to make the image look interesting, but I think anyone who played the game could tell it wasn't moving (I wanted to make a green screen joke here). This resulted in a lot of tweaking coordinates around so the player character's feet touched the "ground". I think I could have tried making the ground a separate object, but then I'd have to consider gravity and all that.</p>
<p>The portal is a great example of me giving up in style. The portal (the yellow swirly one) is supposed to transport the player to another level. Originally, it was supposed to "redraw" a new level in place of the old one. However, I could not get this idea to work. Maybe it was the collision function or the way Pygame renders objects, but the old level screen refused to change.</p>
<p>However, I then remembered I took CMSC216 and learned about the exec family of functions! These functions replace the current process with a new process. I then began looking to see if Python had any similar functions, and I successfully implemented the portal feature - by ending the old process and beginning a new subprocess with the new level. Amazing! A bit extra, but amazing! (It's probably still possible to overwrite the old game screen.)</p>
<p>I considered adding sound effects and music, before realizing just how much of a trainwreck the code was behind the scenes.</p>
