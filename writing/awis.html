<h4>Background</h4>
<p>For Technica 2024, I created a text-based horror video game using the open-source game engine Twine called <i>A Whisper in Steel</i>. I've linked the repository and game files <a href = "https://github.com/laurajlai/AWhisperInSteel">here</a>. </p>

<h4>Inspirations & Beginnings</h4>
<p>My inspirations for this project included indie horror games covered by the YouTube channel The Game Theorists. I wanted to create a game where the players had to put the pieces together by themselves. I don't quite remember where the idea for the steel laboratory came from; I guess it just felt creepy at the time.</p>

<p>I originally had the name "Steel Whispers" - but I changed it to the longer and objectively cooler sounding "A Whisper in Steel." Both names have double meanings, which you might notice if you attempt a playthrough.</p>

<p>While I had this idea to create a game using Twine since I was in high school, and I had even created a design document outlining my story ideas, it languished in my drive for years until this hackathon, when I felt it would be an easy and fun project to whip up in a few days.</p>

<h4>Coding</h4>
<p>I chose to use the Twine engine, as I'd previously developed a few small projects using it during high school, and I could re-learn it just in time for the hackathon. Twine uses HTML/CSS/JS, so this project essentially functions as website with a lot of extra steps and a lot of links. I spent the entire hackathon juiced up on coffee, flipping back and forth between a Twine Sugarcube tutorial page and the rapidly growing web structure. I briefly considered adding images so players wouldn't be staring at pages of text, but I decided to focus on the coding instead.</p>

<h4>What I Might've Done Differently</h4>
<p>Story wise, I admit the ending of <i>A Whisper in Steel</i> is a bit underdeveloped (I think you could tell both my coffee and energy were running low). I think this might be why a lot of indie horror games constantly release sequels, it's hard to wrap things up when you've set the stakes so high.</p>
<p>I might have also tried implementing combat into the game that wasn't just a single-line acknowledgement that you had subdued your opponent. I think that would then bring into question the player running out of HP and having to restore it to avoid a bad ending of outright dying. Maybe too much for a 2-day hackathon while balancing 3 CS classes.</p>
