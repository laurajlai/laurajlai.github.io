<h1>Lying Flat, or Flatly Lying</h1>
<p>A few weeks ago, a friend sent me&nbsp;<a href="https://hilariusbookbinder.substack.com/p/the-average-college-student-today">this article</a>&nbsp;on Substack. I read the whole thing &mdash; and its follow-up post &mdash; from start to finish, taking in every line of the author&rsquo;s growing concern that the current generation of college students were illiterate, disengaged, and distressingly addicted to their phones. And then I read it again. And again. And again.</p>
<p>The entire time, I wanted to write something back. I wanted to say my own piece about the disconnection our students face, but finals and projects got in the way before I could finish.</p>
<p>By the time this is published, I will have finished the 3rd year of my computer science degree. And while my background is mainly in STEM, I see no reason why this should disqualify me from this discussion. I think that the people commenting eagerly about how the kids these days are lazy and don&rsquo;t want to learn anymore deserve to hear another perspective.</p>
<p>As a disclaimer, I don&rsquo;t plan on debating the original author, or anyone else who has raised this argument. I will lose. And as you&rsquo;ll see, we actually have some points in common. I don&rsquo;t gain anything from defending the honor of these random strangers I don&rsquo;t know. I just want to shed some light on what students are going through and maybe provide some notes on what&rsquo;s going on behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Some other notes on my background before we start:</p>
<ol>
<li class = "li-alter">I and most of my friends are all Asian-American. Asian cultures have long prioritized educational achievement, and that&rsquo;s something the diaspora shares. We&rsquo;re more predisposed to try hard and also feel bad if we fail. The memes about your Asian parents getting mad if you get a B+ exist for a reason. The high rates of perfectionism and anxiety exist for the same reason.<br />Hilariously, the author of the original article I mentioned later posted a&nbsp;<a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-161295522">reply</a>&nbsp;article summarizing some of the responses he got. They actually mention the importance of shame and feeling ashamed if you don&rsquo;t know the answer to the question. To quote them: &ldquo;Nobody likes feeling ashamed, I know, but maybe a bit of that would help. When I call on a student and they shrug their shoulders at me in silence, they should feel ashamed. When they bomb an assignment because they didn&rsquo;t do the reading or come to class, being ashamed is the proper response&rdquo; (Bookbinder).<br />That is Asian parent thinking right there! I would joke about getting a job in China if 1. they didn&rsquo;t crack down on online tutoring and 2. they weren&rsquo;t experiencing their own flavor of youth burnout (to be discussed later).</li>
<li class = "li-alter">I know a lot of people are complaining about elementary/middle schoolers, but this article will mostly be about high school and college. Looking back, I think my high school and college experiences most deeply influenced how I view education and how I view the current student mindset.</li>
<li class = "li-alter">If any teachers/professors are reading this, hi! I would genuinely like to talk in more depth; there was a ton of stuff I had to cut for this article. I&rsquo;m available here anytime.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Cynicism</h4>
<p>Upon rereading, I was quite surprised when the author acknowledged that students have always viewed college as transactional. I had assumed this was a recent development among a generation raised to view college as the natural next step after high school. But what they didn&rsquo;t mention was how lopsided the transaction is becoming.</p>
<p>We live in a time where college is necessary but also useless, where degrees are becoming increasingly less meaningful but students have to go nonetheless. Dissatisfaction with the state of American education &mdash; be it K-12 or college &mdash; is one of the few issues everyone agrees with, even if people don&rsquo;t agree on how we can fix the system. A 2025&nbsp;<a href="https://thecollegeinvestor.com/53345/new-poll-reveals-how-americans-feel-about-college-in-2025/#:~:text=Public%20sentiment%20on%20college%20value,it's%20not%20worth%20the%20cost.">survey</a>&nbsp;by the College Investor revealed that only 14% of respondents think that college has a positive return on investment, with 50% saying that college is a break-even and 36% saying it&rsquo;s worthless. The r/GenZ subreddit is filled with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1k7xqya/do_you_think_the_idea_that_as_long_you_have_a/">people</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/mquggu/guys_do_you_think_college_is_worth_it/">questioning</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1cb7oye/gen_z_isnt_lazy_but_college_did_a_terrible_job_of/">the</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1jahxnt/having_a_college_degree_does_not_equal_success/">value</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1jxjeor/am_i_the_only_one_that_has_no_motivation_for/">of</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/nto9i7/i_graduate_in_a_week_and_it_wasnt_worth_it/">college</a>.</p>
<p>For Americans, college isn&rsquo;t just a time commitment, it&rsquo;s also a rather large financial sink. Higher education is rather expensive and many students have to take out loans, leaving them potentially with thousands of dollars in debt. This further tilts the &ldquo;Is college worth it?&rdquo; question towards the negative, because now you&rsquo;re paying money and going into debt for something that might not be worth it. There&rsquo;s a four-letter word for that, something that begins with s&hellip;</p>
<p>For me, I admit I view my college experience as inherently transactional too. I am an out-of-state student, a stranger in a familiar land rejected from in-state schools, and from the beginning I knew the goal of college for me was to return home. I witnessed the cultural discussion about my major shift from &ldquo;Everyone should learn to code!&rdquo; to &ldquo;Holy shit the job market is garbage!&rdquo; right when I was choosing my field of study for college. Even when I tried imagining having a different major, all I cared about was how easy it would be to take multiple required classes in one semester and get my degree over with. I never could fully consider learning outside of the context of &ldquo;it might be useful at some point in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This all makes it sound like I hated college and it wasn&rsquo;t a fit for me. And you&rsquo;re right; maybe I would have benefited from taking a gap year to seriously examine what I wanted from life or going to trade school instead of jumping on the college train. But the question &ldquo;Are you going to college?&rdquo; never came up when I was in high school. It was a given, like the laws of gravity. You might as well have asked &ldquo;Does 1+1 equal 2?&rdquo; It was a question so obvious that it didn&rsquo;t need to be asked. The real questions arose from where I would be going and what kinds of jobs I would get after graduating.</p>
<p>I bring up the transactional nature of college to inform my next few points. Since an increasing number of students see college as an obligation with a few fun events tacked on, this makes them prone to&hellip;</p>
<h4>Easy A(I)</h4>
<p>I do not defend the use of generative AI (just going to say AI from now on) in learning environments. I think blatantly copying from AI is lazy and shameless. One of my most frustrating group project experiences last semester involved one of my group members using AI to write his part of a group paper and not even trying to hide it. Nevertheless, I acknowledge that we have to try and think about why students use AI in the first place. If we don&rsquo;t understand why students use AI to do their work for them, we will never convince them to give the tools up.</p>
<p>With that being said, let&rsquo;s talk about pressure.</p>
<p>Pressure manifests in many forms, but one of the biggest expectations we place on students are grades. Our education experience is shaped by these six or so letters. Grades determine everything from what classes you can take next year to what colleges will accept you to if you&rsquo;ll even graduate. We tell our students to get the highest grades possible in the hardest classes possible, and over time, we internalize it. Good grades are no longer just a nice thing to show off, they&rsquo;re a necessity to having a future. I&rsquo;m about to graduate college soon, and I still wonder if I could have been able to get into better schools if only I got an A in AP Calculus BC instead of a B+.</p>
<p>(I was originally going to mention my own GPA, but if you take me more seriously because I said I have perfect grades, or less seriously because I said I didn&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re proving my point that we care about grades too much.)</p>
<p>Before I continue with the machine-generated elephant in the room, I&rsquo;d like to mention a comparison Derek Thompson made in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/03/teen-anxiety-elite-schools-sat-act-paradox-wealthy-nations/673307/">this article</a>&nbsp;he published in&nbsp;<em class="qz">The Atlantic.&nbsp;</em>Like many adults, Thompson wondered why teens these days seem so unwell (more on that later). After he heard that Columbia University was no longer requiring an SAT or ACT score for admissions, he realized that the crisis in teens&rsquo; mental health wasn&rsquo;t just caused by too much TikTok. He writes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine, by analogy, that you&rsquo;re a parent who is generally interested in your child being healthy &mdash; that is, eating the right foods and engaging in youth sports and playtime. You move to a neighborhood where the parents hold the same value &mdash; fitness is good &mdash; but they take it to extremes. At 5 a.m., every high schooler in the neighborhood participates in a grueling private HIIT class. Parents closely track their kids&rsquo; body-mass index and blood pressure. A while back, one parent entered their child in an international weight-lifting contest, it created a cascade of anxious mimicry, and now all the kids participate in international weight-lifting contests. Each month, one of the kids in the neighborhood is awarded Fittest Kid, and parents display these FK honors with living-room trophies and bumper stickers on their car. Over the years, the neighborhood has produced several bodybuilders and elite athletes, along with high rates of eating disorders and body dysmorphia. This has drawn the attention of researchers, who have concluded that the community has designed a culture of physical achievement that is both highly successful and indisputably crazy.&rdquo; (Thompson)</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p id="a6d6" >For students raised to care about and obsess over grades, school becomes less about taking rewarding risks than about avoiding punishment. The ends justify the means &mdash; no matter how immoral some may find them to be. Who cares if you found the answers to your homework online, you were able to get a perfect score! Who cares if you actually like this class, the reviews say it&rsquo;s an easy A! Who cares if you asked ChatGPT to write your paper in two hours, it&rsquo;s less work for you and your teacher won&rsquo;t know any better! Everything is in service to those letters on a page. As long as you get an A, none of the process matters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not alone in mentioning this. As I was writing this article, I saw&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/the-life-of-a-mexican-high-school-teacher/when-grades-matter-more-than-learning-ai-wins-c5819a932d27">this article</a>&nbsp;on Medium by a teacher saying much the same things as I have. To quote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the current state of things: Parents want their kids to have good grades, teachers know grades will affect the perception of their work, schools want to show off the academic talent in their classroom, and the school system wants good stats to show off. But the point of education is to help students learn and succeed, not boast neat rows of grades.&rdquo; (Rogut)</p>
<p>The vast majority of people who grew up in the American school system just want to pass, and learning the subject is a nice side effect. Students and their families don&rsquo;t gain anything &mdash; if anything, grades cause a lot of stress and misery and don&rsquo;t even prove you actually learned the subject. And teachers have to deal with class after class of burned out, apathetic kids who just want their A&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>You might be saying, &ldquo;Well, this sucks, but that&rsquo;s just the buildup for college. Once you&rsquo;re actually there, then you can focus on the learning!&rdquo; And I would love for you to be right. If I had any advice for my younger self, it would be to stop worrying and love the B. I&rsquo;ve certainly seen my parents care less about my grades and more about my learning now &mdash; though this could also be because they saw firsthand just how pointless grades were during COVID when everyone could barely pay attention in class and still pass. My experiences have shown me that by college, it&rsquo;s too late to fully convince students that grades aren&rsquo;t everything.</p>
<p>In the years before college, many students work late into the night trying to keep their scores up for college apps, watching their school portals diligently, doing extra credit assignments, anything that might boost their scores by a few points. Even when we pass the game of admissions and are finally in college, we may still be weighed down by the factors mentioned in the previous section &mdash; feeling obliged to go to college to please their relatives, being stuck with debt, or trapped in subjects we don&rsquo;t really care about. We&rsquo;ve been taught all their lives that grades are what matter, grades are what define you as a person, and that grades dictate your future. And to an extent &mdash; if we plan to go to grad school (as an increasing number of people are), or look good for companies, or just want to feel good about ourselves because we&rsquo;ve been conditioned to associate high marks with their self worth, grades still do matter.</p>
<p>Obviously, we need some way of measuring success and depth of learning. I&rsquo;m not saying we abolish grades entirely, which would be a logistical nightmare. But it&rsquo;s time that we stop thinking of grades as the ultimate authority of wisdom and our sole metric of merit. COVID and AI haven&rsquo;t broken our education system &mdash; things were falling apart long before 2020. All they&rsquo;ve done is show us &mdash; students, parents, teachers, and society at large &mdash; the detriment of romanticizing a single trait as the pinnacle of academic success.</p>
<h4>POV: You&rsquo;re Reading About the Decay of Educational Interest in a Mandatory Gen Ed</h4>
<p>As I mentioned before, I am a computer science major. My (theoretical) future job depends on millions of people looking intently at these blocks of metal and silicon. So, I&rsquo;ll be honest: I can be a bit biased when it comes to tech. The potential and success of new technologies directly translates into more job openings for me. Critiquing it, therefore, is me biting the hand that fed me in the past, is feeding me now as a student, and will literally feed me in the future. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;ll walk away from this situation shrugging and allowing tech corporations to move fast and break things.</p>
<p>A lot has been said about how today&rsquo;s students are not as attentive as they were in years past. They&rsquo;re gaming in class when they should be taking notes, they lie about needing accommodations so they can keep staring at their devices like drug addicts, et cetera. And I admit, this applies to me too. I don&rsquo;t always pay attention in class. I nod off, I fall asleep, I get bored from sitting still. But this happens with or without my computer in arm&rsquo;s reach, and sometimes even in classes that do have technology bans. It&rsquo;s true that inattentiveness can be exacerbated by computers, but given the circumstances I brought up earlier, I think there&rsquo;s more at play. And keeping that in mind is important as we consider implementing new policies such as phone or social media bans.</p>
<p>For this article, I analyzed several reasons I have not paid attention in class. This isn&rsquo;t a comprehensive list (all these reasons are individualistic and don&rsquo;t take into account the rest of the class), but most of my inattentiveness stems from the below scenarios:</p>
<ol class="">
<li class="li-alter">Not understanding the material.<br />Sometimes there&rsquo;s a concept I just don&rsquo;t understand. This can be worsened if I dip out part way through and have to mentally recalibrate back. At which time, the best I can do is try and focus on what I can hear and hope to catch the recording later (see reason 3).</li>
<li class="li-alter">Boredom.<br />Sometimes, classes just aren&rsquo;t that interesting. I am especially prone to boredom in classes for subjects I already know or if I feel like I&rsquo;m not gaining anything of value in the class. This is a risk for all non-major classes, especially gen ed requirements, which have long drawn&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/o6nenu/mandatory_gen_ed_courses_in_collegeuniversity_is/">criticism</a>&nbsp;for being a waste of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2020/02/10/higher-ed-needs-redesign-gen-ed-real-world-opinion">time</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.psucollegian.com/opinion/columnists/gen-eds-and-my-colossal-waste-of-time-and-money-column/article_c0916562-3e9f-11e8-892d-3b86676ebb3d.html">money</a>.<br />I&rsquo;ve always chosen at least a few non-major classes each semester, if just because I would probably die if I took only computer science classes. But even though I always tried to choose non-major classes that sounded interesting to me, I subconsciously knew that they might not serve me in the future. Remember how I mentioned a class with a technology ban earlier? That was an upper level public policy class. Because the subject did not appeal to me in the slightest, the ban only served to remind me of how pointless the class was.<br />Of the reasons I listed here, I think phones and AI have turbocharged this one the most. For reasons 1 and 3, I could argue that having access to technology runs both ways: you could play video games in class and be judged by your peers, or you could take advantage of online resources to improve your own education by exploring subjects further and looking up videos about the things you missed. In those scenarios, removing all technology from the classroom would run the risk of removing those beneficial use cases and punishing actually responsible students. But there are few ways to use personal technology to eliminate boredom and encourage learning at the same time.</li>
<li class="li-alter">Knowing lecture recordings/notes are going to be available.<br />Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but I think online notes and recording were a pandemic development as more and more classes incorporated online activities like quizzes or discussion boards. I started college after online recordings were normalized as things professors should have for their students, which is why I&rsquo;m asking just to be sure.<br />However, this can cause students to undervalue the live session. You&rsquo;ll get the content online eventually, so you don&rsquo;t have to pay attention or even show up to class. This may result in a heavy midterm grind where you have to sift through an entire backlog of recordings, but what else is 2x video speed for?<br />Even though I try to attend as many classes as possible, I still think these resources are a good thing for students to have. They&rsquo;re an easy way to help review and fill in things I missed originally. I understand that some professors might think they enable students to miss class without consequences and have stopped recording/providing notes. As long as this policy is clearly communicated, I can&rsquo;t really object.</li>
<li class="li-alter">Not feeling well, including being hungry, sick, thirsty, or tired. This doesn&rsquo;t necessarily refer to chronic food insecurity; even just missing a meal can drastically affect your ability to pay attention. It is genuinely hard to pay attention if your stomach keeps begging for food or if you feel like nodding off because you crammed last night.<br />I don&rsquo;t have anything else to add for this one. Going back to paper classwork isn&rsquo;t going to solve chronic hunger. Maybe have a snack bin?</li>
</ol>
<p>A hot topic has been reverting back to paper assignments or even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/phone-free-schools">banning phones from the classroom</a>. By turning our backs on educational technology &mdash; or just technology in the classroom as a whole &mdash; we can eliminate both the threat of students being distracted and the prevalence of AI-generated answers in homework. And&nbsp;<a href="https://eiexchange.com/content/I-banned-cell-phones-in-my-class-what-happened-next">anecdotal</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2025/the-right-call-a-year-after-schools-phone-ban-educators-and-parents-love-it-but-kids-arent-so-sure/">results</a>&nbsp;show that these bans have produced more connection and less distraction.</p>
<p>I initially felt skeptical of wide-reaching device bans, but I never quite understood why. I agreed with the growing consensus that giving children devices is a recipe for disaster, and I saw the bans as providing actual enforcement for smaller-scale bans in specific classes. But something still didn&rsquo;t sit right with me.</p>
<p>If students were not interested in the class material, they would still be bored even if their devices were confiscated. Poorly communicated device policies could become the new Prohibition (insert 1920&rsquo;s joke), where students would either flout device bans, see them as an obligation forced upon them by out-of-touch adults and refuse to take the justifications seriously, or skyrocket their phone usage out of class to make up for lost time. I also wondered if phone bans would join eating vegetables and doing chores as things no one liked, but kids had to put up with because adults said so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to pair these bans with comprehensive and up-to-date digital literacy classes, so students understand how to be safe online. In today&rsquo;s algorithmic age, children &mdash; and adults as well &mdash; need to know how to recognize addictive practices, safeguard their privacy online, and truly internalize the adage that you shouldn&rsquo;t believe everything you see on the Internet. For students, digital literacy classes will show them why device and social media bans are in their best interest. This way, they can adopt digital safety precautions and become more responsible users outside of school as well.</p>
<p>I engaged in a less formal version of this during high school. In English class, I gave a speech on mobile app addiction, mentioning how apps such as Duolingo, Instagram, and Pok&eacute;mon GO take advantage of FOMO (fear of missing out) to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-app-developers-keep-us-addicted-to-our-smartphones-2018-1#duolingo-takes-advantage-of-our-natural-fomo-5">encourage addiction</a>. I briefly touched upon the negative effects social media had on mental health, and presented several&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rsph.org.uk/static/uploaded/d125b27c-0b62-41c5-a2c0155a8887cd01.pdf">evidence-based</a>&nbsp;(at the time) solutions such as flagging high social media use, requiring media literacy classes for graduation, and notifying users if pictures have been digitally altered.</p>
<p>While the issues I mentioned in the speech have not aged well in the slightest, the research I did for this one assignment has continued to shape my attitudes towards social media. The main social media platform I use is Discord, and Discord only holds value for me as a site where my friends are. I try to not get lost in scrolling through an endless series of stories about horrible people doing horrible things. I only joined Instagram in the leadup to college because I needed to use it to find roommates, and I&rsquo;ve never joined or wanted to join TikTok.</p>
<p>To quote my 9th grade speech transcript, &ldquo;Technology is changing society greatly. It has given us the capability to solve complex problems easily, and provides us with tools we can use to simplify our lives. However, it has also presented many challenges to our mental and social lives, by degrading our mental health. As long as we can overcome these challenges, we have nothing to fear from technology.&rdquo;</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDkTgc1SeYU"><h4>Lying Flat</h4></a>
<p>Before I finish this article, I want to briefly discuss youth burnout somewhere outside of the US to see where things could be going. The&nbsp;<em class="qz">Atlantic</em>&nbsp;article I mentioned earlier included a&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-022-00595-2#Sec10">study</a>&nbsp;by two researchers at Korea University, Dirk Bethmann and Robert Rudolf, who wanted to see if there was a relationship between GDP per capita and life satisfaction. They found that while there was a positive correlation between those two factors for adults, the opposite was true for adolescents. It seemed that while adults in developed nations were doing fine, their children were more likely to feel stressed and unhappy.</p>
<p>Even without official studies, it&rsquo;s clear that this wave of burnout and giving up is not just an American problem. Many European nations are also seeing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unicef.org/eu/stories/mental-health-burden-affecting-europes-children">higher</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/health-consumers/opinion/europes-young-people-face-a-mental-health-crisis-a-radical-new-approach-is-needed/">numbers</a>&nbsp;of distressed adolescents. In China, young adults are lying flat (躺平) or letting it rot (摆烂). Some South Korean youth, struggling to find work in a hypercompetitive and expensive nation, jokingly refer to their country as &ldquo;<a href="https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/711631.html">Hell</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geocurrents.info/blog/2023/12/07/hell-joseon-the-paradoxes-of-south-korean-development/">Joseon</a>&rdquo; &mdash; a reference to the rigidly hierarchical Joseon Dynasty that preceded the modern-day Republic of Korea.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take what&rsquo;s going on in China as an example. The Chinese education system is unyieldingly strict. China has a long history of valuing education, and that has not changed in the present day. Many kids spend their entire childhoods in school or extracurricular classes, and as they get older the pressure to succeed only ramps up. This pressure reaches a climax during their senior year of high school, when it&rsquo;s time to take the <i>gaokao</i>. For three days, the entire nation falls quiet as students take what has been coined the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/gaokao-china-toughest-school-exam-in-world">hardest exam in the world</a>, which is the sole factor determining which colleges they can apply to.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, &ldquo;高考改变人生&rdquo;. The gaokao is life-changing, for better or for worse. It defines the lives of Chinese youth and their families, and can continue to influence the rest of their time in China. Some people are genuinely able to&nbsp;<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/_IGZWYOoMEgNj9fns1QRQg">change</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theworldofchinese.com/2021/06/sweat-and-sacrifice-five-stories-of-gaokao/">their</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1000306">lives</a>&nbsp;for the better.

<p>After this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/gaokao-university-entrance-exams-06102024165502.html">arduous</a>&nbsp;experience, many Chinese youth end up working the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3136510/what-996-gruelling-work-culture-polarising-chinas-silicon-valley">996 work schedule</a>&nbsp;&mdash; working from 9 AM to 9 PM, 6 days a week.

There are many stories of employees&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/01/business/china-technology-worker-deaths.html">dying</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3277316/china-man-30-worked-104-days-1-day-dies-organ-failure-court-orders-compensation">due</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ctol.digital/news/xiaomi-employee-death-china-overwork-culture/">to</a>&nbsp;overwork and exhaustion. And since the competition for white-collar jobs is so high, if you quit, there will be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/china/2025/04/10/china-nuclear-jobs/">a lot</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/economic-indicators/article/3269276/chinas-desperate-young-jobseekers-face-fierce-competition-provide-headache-beijing">of</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.selfemployed.com/news/chinas-job-market-struggles-with-record-graduates/">people</a>&nbsp;ready to take your position.</p>
<p>I highly recommend watching the video I linked at the top of this section. It goes into more detail about the topics in this section, including the social pressure to succeed and outperform one&rsquo;s competition.</p>
<p>In 2021, a man named Luo Huazhong&nbsp;<a href="https://chi.st/bugs/tang-ping">posted</a>&nbsp;on the social media platform Tieba about how he had embraced a simple, minimalist lifestyle. Luo had been unemployed for two years, but he didn&rsquo;t think anything was wrong with that. He found that the pressure to perform and succeed came from outsiders trying to impose their own values on him. He considered lying flat a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3153362/what-lying-flat-and-why-are-chinese-officials-standing-it">state of mind</a>, as he felt many things were undeserving of his attention and energy. As he concludes, &ldquo;Lying flat is the only objective truth in the universe. Rest, sleep, or death, the moment when a life full of desire and excitement becomes still and disappears is the embodiment of true justice. I choose to lie flat, and I am no longer afraid&rdquo; (Luo).</p>
<p>And thus, the tang ping movement &mdash; emphasizing work-life balance and leaving the endless grind &mdash; was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-human-identity/202307/the-phenomenon-of-lying-flat-among-chinese-youth">born</a>. Over time, this evolved into a new mentality of &ldquo;<a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3194180/lying-flat-no-more-new-evolution-disillusionment">letting it rot</a>,&rdquo; where people view their situation as unalterable and give up on upward mobility and achievement altogether. Fudan University professor Yu Hai noted that while &lsquo;lying flat&rsquo; was a neutral expression and a choice to stick to the bare minimum, &lsquo;letting it rot&rsquo; implied that people had stopped trying altogether and completely accepted their positions in life (Zuo). Yu viewed &ldquo;rotting&rdquo; as a coping mechanism for young people to shield themselves from social competition and pressure. Like a self-deprecating joke, if someone calls you out for giving up, that would feel hurtful or annoying, but if you adopt the label yourself, you make the criticism less stinging.</p>
<p>Older generations, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60353916">Chinese government</a>, met these movements head on with the usual rebuttals of &ldquo;you&rsquo;re just lazy&rdquo; and &ldquo;you should be ashamed of yourself&rdquo;. The term &ldquo;tang ping&rdquo; was also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-lying-flat-movement-standing-in-the-way-of-chinas-innovation-drive/">censored</a>&nbsp;on Chinese social media. But while the word might have been banned, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3258330/what-light-living-new-china-lifestyle-choice-twist-tang-ping-how-practise-it-reap-benefits">sentiment</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=corZx0a1yRU">remains</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that these attitudes can&rsquo;t be compared one-to-one, but I think their similarities should still be discussed. Tang ping, giving up, Hell Joseon, quiet quitting, C&rsquo;s get degrees, and zombie college students are all different manifestations of the same problem. Young people have a chronic lack of hope in the future. They feel stuck where they are, no longer able to improve their lives like their parents did. They see their hard work repeatedly fail to produce results. They see the world they will live in getting worse and worse, as the people in power do nothing. And so, they decide to give up. I don&rsquo;t think America is destined to become one nation lying flat, but it&rsquo;s a worrying indication of where things might go if nothing changes.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate that enjoying the things you&rsquo;re learning is viewed as a rarity and not a given. But I think that&rsquo;s the inevitable outcome when college has become a means to an increasingly uncertain end. Why bother trying? Nothing about this experience matters. Loving the subject isn&rsquo;t a tangible benefit for a pessimistic and burned out generation.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a student who read this far, thanks for taking the time out of your college apps/policy memo/lab report/coding project/et cetera to read this. I believe in you, and you ought to believe in yourself as well. If you feel tired, take a break. Go for a walk. Get some fresh air. And if all these articles by teachers about how the kids these days lack genuine interest mean anything, your teachers aren&rsquo;t as mean or as unapproachable as you might think. I imagine they would prefer you genuinely try on your assignments and fail rather than rely on AI to succeed.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a teacher, I hope this has been a bit comforting. I can&rsquo;t magically get rid of ChatGPT or reignite the love of learning in burnt-out students, but I do feel for the hardworking faculty trying to keep school as a learning experience. If I had a suggestion, it would be to watch for the mental health of your students. Ask if your students are actually okay &mdash; if they&rsquo;re sleeping and eating well, if they&rsquo;re staying afloat or drowning in their work.</p>
<p>I wanted to give a nice, simple solution that makes everyone happy, but truthfully, I don&rsquo;t have one. It&rsquo;s going to take a lot more than one CS student&rsquo;s Medium article to restore our faith in the merits of education. Regardless, I hope this article can add to the conversation around our disconnected generation, because if we want to restore true learning, we need to have an honest discussion about the obstacles standing in our way. If our students are lying flat, it&rsquo;s our role to extend a hand and help them stand tall.</p>
